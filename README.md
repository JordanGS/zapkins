It's a Jenkins plugin that allows to start and execute the OWASP ZAP security tool (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project).
With this plugin, you can spider and scan a target URL, save alerts security reports in all available formats in ZAProxy (xml, html, json).
At the moment you can not save and load session because of bug in ZAP client API which not permit to save authentication parameters.
